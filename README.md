Java Class and Objects
Java is an object-oriented programming language. The core concept of the object-oriented approach is to break complex problems into smaller objects.

An object is any entity that has a state and behavior. For example, a bicycle is an object. It has

States: idle, first gear, etc
Behaviors: braking, accelerating, etc.
Before we learn about objects, let's first know about classes in Java
